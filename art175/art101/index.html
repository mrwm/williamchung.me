                <p>In this exercise, I leaned to use sine wave function (which I used in oscillating the width of the red ellipse), nested for loops, and other functions within processing.

            <p>1. I have  no idea what a good definition of how any kind of artist can use algorithms in their art, but I think most artists use some form of algorithm though.</p>
            <p>2. Some examples in where I might have already used algorithms in my art  work include putting down a pen and drawing a line or shape.</p>
            <p>3. I think that Harold Cohen and AAron's art is in the abstract outcomes and the unpredictability of outcomes. I believe that the outcome of the tree is also a form of art. The next artist, Miguel Nobrega's Super Fiscie. I think his art is in the progra,. Lastly, I also think that the art is in the program in the pentametron.</p>
            <p>4. A well known artist I consider to have an iconic style would be Tim Burten and his Gothic Style. As described, his style has a gothic look mixed with a hint of modernism.</p>
            <p>5. The Rock Paper Scissor Spock Lizard article is pretty straight foward and has few steps explaining how the game works. The articles about brushing teeth and making pizza, however, are detailed and concise at the same time. Lastly, the articles about making a plane and making instructions are pretty short and not extremely detailed.</p>

            <p>1. To sum up the differences when given the Wikipedia definitions of data and information, data is to value, while information is to knowledge.</p>
            <p>2. The difference between visualization and mapping is that visualization is the process of data while the mapping is the organization of the data that is currently available.</p>
            <p>3. Manovich is referring to how visualization is something that is not subliminal and that there could be many different aspects to the processing of visualization. Yes, I agree with his notion.</p>
            <p>4. Feltron is a graphic designer that worked with data that pertained to location and user-generated information. Felton created posters, yarn compositions, and other things that represented the information that he has collected. </p>
